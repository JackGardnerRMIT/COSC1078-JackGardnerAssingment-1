                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Using the Myers-Briggs test found at www.16personalities.com I was able to find out more about my personality, political views, 
                            prime relationship status and physical and mental health. The 16 personalities test covers an introduction of my personality.

                    <h3>Personal characteristics</h3>
                        <p>
                            The test predicted based on my answers that my political views would “align with those of the traditional Conservative” and that I “probably have peak physical health” 
                            based on my answers. For relationships: my conscientiousness score was above the 50th percentile. My agreeableness score was below the 50th percentile.

                        </p>
                    <h3>Test Results</h3>
                        <img src="assets/myers-briggs.png">
                    <h3>My personality profile</h3>
                        <p>
                            The 16 personalities test categorised me as Logistician in sections ISTJ-A / ISTJ-T. 
                            An overview of Logistician personalities from 16 Personalities describes them as having “integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a 
                            vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military”. 
                            The Logistician personality makes up roughly 13% of the population and is quite common. 16Personalities also goes onto say “People with the Logistician personality type 
                            enjoy taking responsibility for their actions and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy 
                            completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.” This is meant to highlight the unique dedication and work ethic of Logisticians.
                        </p>
                    <h3>My traits as a Logistician</h3>
                        <img src="assets/16personalities.png">
                    <h3>Advantages and disadvantages of Logistician</h3>
                        <p>
                            16 Personalities also details the advantages and weaknesses of be a Logistician. Some advantages listed include being “honest and direct” to people, 
                            “strong-willed and dutiful” in work and conversation, “very responsible” for a variety of tasks, “calm and practical” while handling situations, 
                            “create and enforce order” for organising tasks and “Jacks-of-all-trades” to be useful in numerous areas and tasks. 
                            Some disadvantages listed include being “stubborn” towards ideas, “insensitive” and sometime hurtful to others with harsh honesty, 
                            “always by the book” which limits ability to experiment, “judgemental” which may create conflicts and issues and “often unreasonably blame themselves” 
                            this can be draining for Logisticians and the people around them and can cause burnout and a lack of self-trust.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Romantic relationships, friendships, parenthood and careers</h3>
                        <p>
                            In terms of romantic relationships Logisticians are describes as “dependable through and through”, however “their reserved nature often makes dating Logisticians challenging”. 
                            Meaning I can be relied upon to complete tasks; however, communication and agreeance may be an issue. Logisticians as friends are described as “not talkative, or particularly 
                            playful in their affection”, however “Logisticians stay by their friends’ sides no matter what, with a deepness of commitment”. 
                            This may be an issue for communication but reflects dedication to the group. For parenthood “Logisticians do not take their roles as parents lightly and will make it their 
                            work to ensure that this tradition is upheld to the highest standard”. For careers “Logisticians are much more focused on building long-term, stable careers” and “are almost a 
                            stereotype for the classic hard-working, dutiful employee”.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Summary of the Logistician profile</h3>
                        <p>
                            16 Personalities gives a short summary of the Logistician personality by stating “Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as Logisticians. 
                            Known for their reliability and hard work, Logisticians are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. 
                            Logisticians’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.”
                        </p>
                    <h3>What these test results mean for me</h3>
                        <p>
                            These test results generally indicate that I am introverted and do not like social interaction. I am also not very agreeable which tends to mean I am competitive in nature. 
                            I am very conscientious and like to be well organised and prepared. I also score highly in neuroticism, meaning I am likely prone to stress and mental illness. 
                            I terms of openness I am very traditional and tend to keep to myself. In terms of psychopathy, I have a low score and am likely not a psychopath. 
                            I have a low score in Machiavellianism, indicating a high sense of morality. I also have a very low level or narcissism and self-pride.
                        </p>
                    <h3>How will the test results influcene my behaviour in a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            In terms of team behaviour, these results tend to suggest that I am introverted and competitive. This may not be the best traits for a team member, 
                            as you would usually want clear and coherent communication and few arguments and disagreements. I am also organised and can help with planning and ensuring that things are 
                            completed on time to a high standard, which may be helpful for managing the project and submitting it.
                        </p>
                    <h3>How will the test results influence me when forming a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            When forming a team, I should try to look for people who are not too confrontational, as I want to avoid arguments and confliction opinions. 
                            I should seek out people who are somewhat extraverted to have some level of communication for team members. 
                            I should also find team members who are organised and can work and understand me and the activities I do, 
                            otherwise it may be difficult to keep on the same page as my other group members.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Personality Max learning style test at https://personalitymax.com/learning-styles-test/ explores the best way for a person to learn and retain new information. 
                            The test focuses on the primary three senses, what you can see, feel, and hear. It locates your strongest learning styles and explains how to best use them.
                        </p>
                    <h3>My dominant learning style</h3>
                        <p>
                            The test determined that “visual is [my] primary learning style”. I learn best by seeing, I “learn visually whenever you gain information from sight.” 
                            The test suggests that I “benefit greatly from teaching that utilizes illustrations, charts, diagrams, videos, etc.”
                        </p>
                    <h3>Learning styles score graph</h3>
                        <img src="assets/graph1.png">
                    <h3>Visual Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some characteristics of a visual learner include “being good at remembering people's faces, accurately recognizes body language and facial expressions, 
                            able to picture things in their mind, good at taking notes in the form of text and doodles, comprehends visual information such as charts, graphs and diagrams, 
                            recalls appearances with ease, appreciates pictures and illustrations in books, enjoys learning from video presentations, learns well from flash cards and notices 
                            visual details that others might miss.”
                        </p>
                    <h3>Kinaesthetic Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            The test determined that my second-best learning style was Kinaesthetic. Kinaesthetic is learning by doing, it is “physical activity with practical hands-on experience”. 
                            Some characteristics of a Kinaesthetic learner include “being good at learning through hands-on experience, often bored with traditional textbook learning, likes to move 
                            around and explore their environment, usually enjoys athletics and physical education, likes to touch objects and people, would rather participate than watch, appreciates 
                            opportunities to go on field trips, gets satisfaction from building with their hands, enjoys classes with physical experiments and can become restless without physical activity.” 
                            It was also stated that Kinaesthetic learners “would rather participate than watch, appreciates opportunities to go on field trips, gets satisfaction from building with their hands, 
                            enjoys classes with physical experiments and can become restless without physical activity.”
                        </p>
                    <h3>Auditory Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            The test then determined that auditory learning was my least preferred learning style. Auditory style is “learning by hearing.” Some characteristics of auditory 
                            learners include “good at remembering people's names, recalls spoken information with ease, aware of and easily distracted by sounds, enjoys listening to audio books 
                            and storytelling, often skilled at speaking, prefers classes in lecture format, may record lectures to hear again later, benefits from reading out loud, enjoys rhymes 
                            and rhythmic pattern in language and benefits from group discussions.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Best learning styles graph</h3>
                        <img src="assets/graph2.png">
                    <h3>What these test results mean for me</h3>
                        <p>
                            The results of this test seem to suggest that I should try to learn mostly visually as it would be the best may for me to collect and retain information. 
                            I am also able to learn fair well from hands on experience. This means that having a mentor visually explain and demonstrate tasks to be as I physically 
                            do them would be the best way for be to learn.
                        </p>
                    <h3>How will the test results influcene my behaviour in a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            These results may influence my behaviour in a team; by encouraging me to see what my team members are doing and understand what they want by working with them hands on. 
                            As opposed to trying to understand what they want by way of verbal communication.
                        </p>
                    <h3>How will the test results influence me when forming a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            I should take this into account when looking for team members and find other team members who are able to do hand on experience with me and visually communicate with me so 
                            I can better understand, communicate, and learn from them and what they require of me.
                        </p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Mind Tools Creativity Test</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            On Mind Tools creativity test at https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm I received a score of 50. This score indicates that my “creativity is a work in progress.” 
                            The test recommends that I “adopt a collaborative approach to problem finding and work actively with others to create and innovate.” This is encouraging me to do more teamwork to 
                            improve my creativity skills and to get help from others with more creativity. The test suggests that I become more prepared by having “interesting” problems that “arouse curiosity”. 
                            It also stated that “creating a plan to implement a solution” would be beneficial.
                        </p>
                    <h3>What these test results mean for me</h3>
                        <p>
                            The results of this test means that I am not a highly creative person, I do have some foundations in that area, but if I am working in a group then I 
                            should not focus to heavily on creativity and try to collaborate with team members when trying to think of new and create ideas. 
                            This may also be improved if I work creatively in areas that interest me.
                        </p>
                    <h3>How will the test results influcene my behaviour in a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            These results may influence my behaviour in a team my encouraging me to work more with team members when approaching tasks that require creativity. 
                            This is due to my team members likely having more creative skill than me.
                        </p>
                    <h3>How will the test results influence me when forming a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            I should take this into account when forming a team, by try to find team members who are very creative and are good at communicating their ideas and perspectives.
                            This will help the team have more creative and innovative ideas that may not be possible with just me.

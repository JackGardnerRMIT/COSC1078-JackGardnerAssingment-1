        <h3>An overview of the project</h3>
            <p>
                This is project will be an online service which allows customer to select and order car and motorbike part from a database of car and motorbike parts or 
                create the blueprint of their own part on the projects website. The order from the customer will be taken by the website and sent to 3D printing machines 
                on the site of the business which will then print the order. One the piece has been printed and has been checked for quality and errors the piece will then be 
                mailed to the customer. The customer will make an account, add payment details, select their address, and order their parts on the project’s website.
            </p>
        <h3>My motivation to do this project</h3>
            <p>
                This project will be an interesting and innovative way of providing people in need of car and motorbike parts. It makes the process easy and efficient as the process it almost 
                completely online for the customer. Many Australians find accessing parts they require for cars and motorbikes very difficult. This is due to a lack of manufacturers and importation 
                issues from Australia’s isolation. This would lower prices, make the process easier and faster with a high level of quality assurance. There is a large market for new car and motorbike 
                parts for both modern and old models which is not an issue for 3D printing.
            </p>
        <h3>A detailed description of the features of the project</h3>
            <p>
                The main part of the project will exist on an online web application. On this application the customer will create an account with details including their name, email, address, 
                payment details and other important information that the website will record to verify the user’s identity and to use when doing orders, such as using an email or phone number to 
                verify the user’s identity or an address to predict shipping date times and costs for the user’s information when ordering a product. After the customer has created an account, 
                they will be able to search a database of car and motorbike parts which they can filter through. This database will be divided into car or motorbike, model, year, company which 
                produced it; this database will also allow for parts with names or codes to be searched for as most manufactured vehicles have codes and names for parts used. This allows the customer 
                to choose a wide variety of parts and how many of each part they want, this may be a small order of one part or a large order of parts. If the part does not exist, the user would 
                be able to upload documents of a blueprint on the website to be produced, these blueprints could detail dimensions, sizes, materials, and other important information to accurately 
                produce their desired item. Once the order has been placed on the website the order will be sent to the operators of the 3D printers who will use a variety of materials to produce 
                the desired order. The customer will verify their address to ensure that it has not changed or that they do not want it sent elsewhere, an email can also be sent to the user to verify 
                the purchase and ensure that the account is not compromised for security reasons. The best 3D printer for large parts suitable for cars would be the Envision TEC E-Model 3D printer 
                released in 2017, specially made for general market manufacturing. It can work for long periods of time to finish large projects overnight as to not waste time, which would be 
                preferred if there were large or numerous orders placed. Some of the materials that could be used for the 3D printed parts include plastics, styrene, polylactic acid, polycarbonate, 
                polyamides, polypropylene, metals, and glass fibre composites. Once the part has been ordered from the database the operator of the 3D printer will have a template of the ordered 
                product and will simply have to select the item to be printed. If the item is custom and does not belong in the existing database, then it will need to be created in a 3D design 
                software, such as 3D Design which is a software that allows parts to be designed in software and visualised and then printed in 3D printers. After the parts have been printed, 
                they must be sorted and packaged to be sent to the customers address which they provided when singing up to the website which they also confirmed when they placed the order. 
                Some of the smaller parts produced could be mailed to the customers address using Australia Post. Some of the larger parts may not be easily mailed and may require vehicles, 
                such as trucks to transport larger pieces to the customer’s address.
            </p>
        <h3>A description of the software, hardware, and open-source tools appropriate for the project </h3>
            <p>
                There will be both software and hardware required for this project. The software required for this project will have to be in the form of a web application which takes the users 
                information and order and then sends that information and order to the business, there will also be software operating the 3D printers, which will design the parts. 
                At the business there will be hardware equipment in the form of 3D printers which will produce the customer’s order. That will be the main software and hardware involved 
                in the business process. There are various databases detailing the blueprints of car and motorbike parts that can be used for reference form the customer and the 3D printers.
            </p>
        <h3>A list of skills required to complete the project</h3>
            <p>
                Some of the skills required to complete the project include being a competent web developer who is fluent in programming languages including HTML, CSS, PHP and possibly Python or JavaScript. 
                These skills will ensure that the project has a functioning website that can be easily used by the customer, the many languages may be required due to the many functions that must 
                exist on the website for the customer. Another skill required would be understanding and being able to work with 3D printers to ensure the best possible results for the customer, 
                this would be managing the 3D printers and preventing errors or reducing costs.
            </p>
        <h3>Outcome of the project</h3>
            <p>
                If the project is successful and fully developed, there will be a fully functioning online website available for all Australians which will allow then to order new car and motorbike 
                parts to be mailed to them. It will solve the issue of a need in the Australian market for car and motorbike parts. This is solved by creating new parts which can easily be accessed. 
                This development will impact the car and motorbike and repair industry in Australia. This may provide a wide variety of customers from many parts of Australia with new parts which may 
                change how many parts are manufactured and how vehicles are repaired.
            </p>
        <h3>Interest, passion, and importance in the project</h3>
            <p>
                This project is important as it would innovate and help the Australian car and motorbike repair and manufacturing industry with its many issues. 
                This is interesting as much of this technology is new and not well used or explored by technology companies. 
                I am very passionate about this as I enjoy being innovative with technology and I have a passion for cars and motorbikes.
            </p>
        <h3>Potential drawbacks or obstacles I anticipate</h3>
            <p>
                I would anticipate there would be a long process to develop the software fully, there would be testing required and updates for any issues or missing features. 
                3D printing mass orders would also be a challenge and would require vast quantities of 3D printing machines and materials. 
                The products would also need to be transported to the customer, some small pieces may be mailed, however larger parts may require to be transported in trucks to the customers addresses. 
                This would also be expensive to initially setup.
            </p>
        <h3>What kind of IT innovation would you like to see </h3>
            <p>
                I would like to see more innovation in 3D printing technology to improve products produced which can improve certain products as this technology is new and under used and researched, 
                I believe there is more potential, for this technology in many manufacturing industries.

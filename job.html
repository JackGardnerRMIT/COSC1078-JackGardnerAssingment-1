        <h3>My ideal job</h3>
            <p>
                My ideal job is wokring as a Penetration Tester. An example of this job can be found at:

        <h3>A description of a Penetration Tester</h3>
            <p>
                The position of a Junior Penetration Tester for Shea involves testing web application and software’s security functions, 
                you aim to find any flaws in the security and assist in patching the issues that allowed for exploitation of the software. 
                The job will include a lot of testing of the software, it will have a process of trial and error, attempting multiple methods to exploit software. 
                The reason I find this job appealing is because I think it would be interesting and challenging to attempt to penetrate software. 
                It would also be rewarding if you did find exploits and were successful in your job. Another reason is high pay, 
                experienced penetration testers often are paid over 100 thousand AUD per year. 
                It would also require little travel and would allow the worker to do their job in the comforts of their own home.
            </p>
        <h3>Skills, qualifacations and experince required to become a Penetration Tester</h3>
            <p>
                There are many skills, qualifications and experience required to become a Junior Penetration Tester as Shea. 
                Some of the skills required to work this job include clear communication and dedication. 
                Clear communication is a key skill that is essential for when working with teams of other employees at Shea, 
                it is also important when making written and verbal reports of Penetration Testing results and speaking to managers for tasks. 
                Dedication is also a highly important skill which would be necessary for the longevity and success of your career. 
                Dedicated study and a high work ethic specific to the field of Cyber-Security can led to being a better Penetration Tester, 
                it also shows that you are willing to spend lots of time working at your job and that you are passionate about it. 
                There is no official qualification required, such as a University Degree; however, some abilities what are requited include being “Proficient in Linux, 
                Mac or Windows command lines”, “A general understanding of the HTTP protocol” and “Proven coding or scripting skills in one or more languages, for example: 
                TypeScript, Java, C#, Ruby, Python or Shell scripting such as Bash.” All these abilities include being able to understand computing protocol or speaking a programming language, 
                which is required to be able to do Penetration Testing. Some experience required is that you must “have previously built a web application either professionally or as a hobbyist.” 
                This experience will help the employee understand how to do their job and how web applications function.
            </p>
        <h3>Skills, qualifacations and experience I currently have</h3>
            <p>
                Currently I have a limited selection of skills, qualifications, and experience. Some of the skills I possess include communication, dedication, resilience, creativity, and problem solving. 
                I can do both verbal and written communication with other team members and people who I work with, this can be for reports or other issues. 
                I am very dedicated and can spent a great deal of time trying to solve a problem. I am also very resilient and able to persist through setbacks and obstacles. 
                I am able creative and can think of new ways to approach issues. I am also proficient in problem solving and can work around issues to find a solution. 
                I do not have any formal qualifications that are required for this job yet. I am yet to get a University degree, 
                the closest thing I have to a qualification is my Victorian certificate of education. I currently lack sufficient experience for this job. 
                I have done Cyber-Security research in school and I am currently partaking in Cyber-Security research in my own personal time.
            </p>
        <h3>My plan on how I will obtain the required skills, qualifacations and experience to become a Penetration Tester</h3>
            <p>
                I currently lack the sufficient skills, qualifications and experience required to work as a penetration tester. 
                In order to build on my skills and experience I must do more projects and work on in the cyber security area. 
                This would improve my skills by giving me the opportunity to practice my communication, creativity and problem solving and will improve my resilience and dedication. 
                This experience would teach me how to be a competent penetration tester and do IT related work. I could also qualify myself by successfully achieving my University degree.

    <h1>Intrest in IT</h1>

        <h3>My intrest in IT</h3>
            <p>
                I have a bug interest in Information Technology. This interest is not limited to some aspects of Information Technology, such as coding or design. 
                I have a big passion of almost every part of it, except for databases which bores me to death. 
                My interest in Information Technology was first sparked when I was around 14 years old when I wanted a computer. 
                I discovered that building my own computer would be much cheaper and more fun than buying an already existing one, so I began to build an obsession with computers and technology. 
                Now I still build PC’s and do hardware engineering, however my current biggest interest in Information Technology is currently software development. 
                Most of my experience in Information Technology comes from my own research and interest which I have done in my personal time. In that time, I have designed and developed websites, games, 
                build PC’s and have partaken in many other individual and group projects. I have also some experiences with Information Technology in school, I have had subjects in 3D printing, 
                Information Technology, Digital Design, Software Development, Robotics and more.
            </p>
        <h3>Why I choose to come to RMIT</h3>
            <p>
                I chose to come to RMIT for many reasons. 
                The first one being its reputation, RMIT has a positive reputation for being a well organised and innovative University which provides a positive environment for its students. 
                Another reason is that RMIT has a strong focus on practical work as opposed to theoretical work that you would expect to see as Universities such as Monash. 
                I much prefer practical work as I find it helps me learn better and I can concentrate better that way, it is also more realistic of what to expect in the workplace. 
                I also wanted to go to RMIT due to their program for work experience, I believe that this will increase my chances of getting a job and it will increase many of my skills, 
                such as teamwork and communication. Another big reason for me choosing to attend RMIT was transportation, I can walk two minutes to my local train station, get off a Flinger’s Street station, 
                walk a few blocks and then I am at RMIT. The transportation is simple, relatively cheap with a student concession card and does not take too long. 
                However other Universities such as Monash have limited transportation and would be harder to access.
            </p>
        <h3>What I expect to learn during my studies</h3>
            <p>
                I expect to learn a wide variety of skills and knowledge that I can apply to my job once I join the work force. 
                I am hoping to develop my skills in Information Technology in a wide range of areas. 
                I expect to learn how to code and develop software to an advanced level, this can be for web pages, applications, games, and other pieces of software. 
                I also expect to learn how to design products efficiently, so that they are user friendly and useful. I would also like to understand networking and databases.

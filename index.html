        <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Jack Gardner I am a University student currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. 
                My student number is: 3900738 and my email is: s3900738.student.rmit.edu.au.
            </p>
        <h3>Where I have been</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and have always lived in Melbourne. I have visited every corner of Australia from Perth to Brisbane and even to Sydney, I know disgusting.
                I have also travelled to Europe, visiting the UK, France, and Italy. I have also been to China where I ate too many dumplings.  
            </p>
        <h3>My nationality and education</h3>
            <p>
                I am ethnically half English and half Scottish. I am an atheist; however, I was sent to an Anglican school where I learnt that Jesus loves me. 
                The school, I attended was Mentone Grammar, I attended from 3-Year-Old Kindergarten in 2006 to Year 12 in 2020.
            </p>
        <h3>Skills sports and pets</h3>
            <p>
                I speak English and enough German to get by; however, I think it is time to learn Mandarin-Chinese.
                I am an enthusiastic sports fan; I play Soccer as a defender and I have also played Table Tennis because I am lazy and do not like running. 
                I am also a fan of watching Boxing, however I do not partake as I enjoy my nose how it is. I used to have a rabbit and 2 cats, now I have 3 Goldfish, because they are far more interesting.  
            </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I also have a crippling addiction to gaming; I have spent roughly one thousand and a half hours playing Overwatch only to lose almost every game I play. 
                Another interest I have is in Motorcycles; I currently have a Kawasaki KLX 150 for off-road use. 
                I plan to get a Kawasaki 250 to do my Learners on and then get a Yamaha R6 once I am on my Provisional plates, 
                my interest in Motorcycles in for fun and I am not attempting to become a professional racer in MotoGP.
